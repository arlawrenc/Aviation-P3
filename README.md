# Problem
Aviation-P3 is an analysis of flight arrival delays of major airlines coming to Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson International Airport.

A Machine Learning algorithm utilizing a Scikit library is deployed to offer real time predications of the percentage possibility of flights arriving late based on the city of departure, date and time of day.

# The Project considers the following questions:
 •	From what cities of origin are the greatest number of late arrivals.
 
 •	What airlines most frequently have the highest number of late arrivals?
 
 •	Does the season impact percentage of late arrivals?
 
# The Project will analyze data within the following constraints.
 •	City of Origin
 
 •	Airline
 
 •	Seasonality.
 
# Data was culled from the following sources:
 •	Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

# Cleaning of the data:
 •	International flights were filtered from the data
 
 •	Filtered out N/A (these data points did not contain enough data)
 
 •	Final dataset contained 508,000 rows.

# The Project utilized several tools in the compilation, analysis and delivery of the data, including:
To consolidate, clean and visualize core data:
 •	Python Pandas 
 
 •	Python Matplotlib
 
 •	MongoDB Database
 
 •	Tableau.
 
# To deliver and share the cleaned, analyzed data:
 •	HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
 
 •	Tablueau
 
 •	Heroku
 
 •	FTP host
 
 •	Flask.
